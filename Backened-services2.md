# AWS Documentation  

This documentation outlines the steps for setting up **Security Groups**, **Amazon RDS**, **AWS Elastic Cache**, and **Amazon MQ**.

## Security Groups  

Security Groups (SG) act as virtual firewalls for your resources on AWS.  

### Steps to Create Security Groups:  
1. **Create a Security Group for Tomcat or Beanstalk Environment**  
   - Configure this SG to allow traffic as per your application needs.  

2. **Create a Security Group for Backend Services**  
   - Allow all traffic internally within the backend SG to ensure seamless communication between services.

## Amazon RDS  

Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) simplifies database management without requiring SSH access for configuration. It uses **Parameter Groups** for managing database settings.  

### Steps to Set Up RDS  
1. **Create a Parameter Group**  
   - Navigate to RDS in the AWS Console.  
   - Create a new Parameter Group and customize the settings as needed.  

2. **Create a Subnet Group**  
   - Specify the subnets where your database will be accessible.  

3. **Launch an RDS Instance**  
   - Select **MySQL** as the database engine.  
   - Keep the default settings unless specific customizations are required.  
   - Start the database creation process.

## AWS Elastic Cache  

AWS Elastic Cache is a managed in-memory caching service. Its creation process resembles that of RDS and involves **Parameter Groups**.  

### Steps to Set Up Elastic Cache  

1. **Create a Parameter Group**  
   - Select **Memcached** as the parameter family.  
   - Use default settings or adjust based on requirements.  

2. **Create a Subnet Group**  
   - Provide a name for the Subnet Group.  
   - Select the appropriate **VPC** and subnets.  

3. **Create a Cluster**  
   - Use the default settings and proceed to create the cluster.

## Amazon MQ  

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that supports RabbitMQ.  

### Steps to Set Up Amazon MQ  

1. **Select RabbitMQ**  
   - Navigate to the Amazon MQ service and choose **RabbitMQ**.  

2. **Instance Configuration**  
   - Select **Single Instance** for simplicity.  
   - Provide a name for the instance.  
   - Choose the smallest instance type for basic use cases.
